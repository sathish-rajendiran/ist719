1. I did this homework by myself, with help from the book and the professor. 


```{r}
# getting started
x <- 4 
pie(c(1,2))
?pie()
#aspect ratio  height to width
x <- 4 
fname <- "/Users/sathishrajendiran/Documents/Sathish/Others/Masters/Syracuse/Courses-Term5/IST719/Week1/lab.pdf"


```

```{r}
?pie()

#aspect ratio  height to width
pdf(file = fname,width = 4,height = 4)
pie(c(1,2,3))
# dev.off()


```
